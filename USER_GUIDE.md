## 1. Getting Started

### Registration (Creating Your Account)
Before you can use the vault, you need a user account.
1.  Open the application.
2.  You will see a **Login** screen. Click the button that says **"Switch to Register"**.
3.  **Username**: Pick a name you will recognize.
4.  **Password**: Choose a strong password for your account login.
    *   *Note*: This is just for logging into the app. Your *Vault* will have its own special password later.
5.  Click **Register**.

### Logging In
1.  Enter the Username and Password you just created.
2.  Click **Login**.
    *   *Security Feature*: If you type the wrong password 3 times, the app will lock you out for 30 seconds. This stops hackers from trying to guess your password repeatedly.

## 2. Understanding the Basics

Before we store passwords, let's define the tools you'll be using:

*   **The Vault**: Think of this as a secure folder. You can have multiple vaults (e.g., one for "Work", one for "Personal").
*   **Master Password**: This is the **most important** password. It is the key that encrypts (locks) your vault. We do not know this password. You must remember it.
*   **Item**: A single record in your vault. It usually contains a Website Name, a Username, and a Password.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🟢 Creating Your First Vault
When you log in for the first time, you need a place to put your passwords.
1.  Look for the **"Vaults"** section on the left sidebar.
2.  Click the **"+" (Plus)** button.
3.  **Vault Name**: Give it a name like "My Passwords".
4.  **Master Password**: Enter a very strong password.
    *   *Tip*: Use a phrase like "Blue-Elephant-Dances-At-Midnight" to make it easy to remember but hard to guess.
5.  Click **Create**.

### 🔓 Unlocking Your Vault
Your vault stays locked (encrypted) until you need it.
1.  Click on your vault name in the sidebar.
2.  A window will pop up asking for your **Master Password**.
3.  Enter it and press **Unlock**.
4.  Your vault is now open! You will see your list of saved items.

### ➕ Adding a New Password
1.  Click the **"Add Item"** button.
2.  **Title**: What is this for? (e.g., "Netflix", "Gmail", "Amazon").
3.  **Username**: The email or name you use to log in to that site.
4.  **Password**: Enter the password for that site.
    *   **Pro Tip**: Don't use "password123". Click the **"Generate Strong Password"** button. The app will create a super-secure password for you.
5.  **Website**: (Optional) You can paste the link to the login page here.
6.  Click **Save**.

### 👁️ Viewing and Using Passwords
1.  Click on an item in your list to expand it.
2.  **To See the Password**: Click the **Eye Icon (👁️)**. The dots will turn into text.
3.  **To Copy the Password**: Click the **Clipboard Icon (📋)**.
    *   The password is now copied. You can go to your browser and paste it (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).
    *   *Safety Check*: After 60 seconds, the app will automatically remove the password from your clipboard so you don't paste it by mistake later.

### 🎨 Changing the Theme
Make the app look the way you want.
1.  Look for the **Theme Button** in the top right corner (it might look like a Moon 🌙, Sun ☀️, or Diamond 💎).
2.  Click it repeatedly to cycle through:
    *   **Light**: Clean and bright.
    *   **Dark**: Easy on the eyes at night.
    *   **Cyan**: A cool, blue-toned theme.
    *   **Forest**: A calming green theme.
    *   **Premium**: A sleek, colorful gradient design.

## 4. Safety Best Practices

*   **Never share your Master Password**. Not even with us. We will never ask for it.
*   **Don't reuse your Master Password**. Make it unique to this app.
*   **Let the Generator do the work**. Humans are predictable. Computers are not. Use the "Generate Strong Password" feature for every new account you create online.
*   **Close the app**. When you are done, close the app or click "Logout" to ensure your vault is locked.

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot my Master Password. Can you reset it?**
A: **No.** Because we respect your privacy, we designed the system so that *only* you have the key. If you lose the Master Password, the data in that vault is lost forever. You will need to create a new vault.

**Q: Why does the app say "Application Locked"?**
A: You were inactive for 5 minutes. This is a safety feature. Just enter your Master Password to pick up where you left off.

**Q: Why can't I login?**
A: If you typed your account password wrong 3 times, you are temporarily blocked. Wait 30 seconds and try again.
